# Application Design

 * Introduction to Fragments

   A life cycle inventory model describes a network of dependency
   relationships among a set of industrial processes.  For example, doing
   laundry depends on operation of a washing machine and a dryer, which in
   turn requires heated water, detergent, electricity, and fabric softener
   or other chemicals.  Heated water, in turn, depends on a water supply
   and the combustion of natural gas for heat; the natural gas supply
   depends on extraction, processing, and distribution of natural gas; and
   so on.

   Life cycle impact assessment is the term for assigning impact scores to
   a set of environmental emissions implicated by a given life cycle
   inventory model.  The process works by matching individual emissions
   with scores for a given impact method, and adding up the total score.

   A life cycle inventory fragment is a term for a subset of a life cycle
   inventory model described as a "tree," e.g. having one root node and a
   branching pattern that does not include any loops.  Fragments can be
   nested inside one another, enabling a modular, hierarchical model
   design.  

   The purpose of this program is to (1) provide graphical depictions of
   fragment models that allow a user to view and explore them, and (2)
   compute life cycle impact scores to support contribution, sensitivity,
   and scenario analysis of the fragments.

 * Fragment Structure

   A fragment is a network of nodes and edges laid out as a tree.  The

 * Scenario Structure

   A scenario is a set of variations from the base version of the fragment
   model.  A scenario is specified as a list of parameters; each parameter
   is specified as a list of parameter instances.  Parameters have several
   different types, each of which affects the LCIA computation in a
   different way.  A set of related scenarios is called a Scenario Group.
   A scenario group belongs to a single user; however, that scenario group
   can also be marked as publicly viewable.

   Scenarios include Parameters and Substitutiuons, encoded in the
   following Data Tables: 
    - User
    - ScenarioGroup

   and the following Type Enumeration table:
    - ParamType

 * Fragment Computation

   A fragment is "computed" for a given scenario and a given LCIA Method.
   The parameterization identified in the named scenario is adopted, and
   then an impact score is computed for each node of the fragment under the
   named LCIA Method.  The node scores are cached in the database.
   Computing a fragment may require recursion into sub-fragments; after the
   recursion is complete, the sub-fragments' scores are expected to be
   stored in the cache table.

   The computation results are stored in the following tables:
    - NodeCache - stores node weights per scenario
    - ScoreCache - stores LCIA results per node * scenario
    - BackgroundCache - stores LCIA results for background processes

   The computation process requires three successive steps:
    1. Fragment traversal, including recursion into sub-fragments
    2. Node score computation, including recursion into sub-fragments
    3. Fragment score computation, by adding up weighted node scores

 * Background and Foreground Processes

   Nominally fragments include processes that occur within some limited
   scope; but most such processes depend on other upstream processes that
   exist outside their immediate scope (such as electricity production).
   The Background table matches intermediate flows satisfied by background
   processes to inventory entries that resolve the flows.  

   Users can adjust these relationships in scenarios.  If a user overrides
   a particular background relationship, then all fragments with
   corresponding flows that resolve to background processes will
   automatically resolve to the override process instead of the default.
   This allows, for instance, a user to choose a different process for
   diesel fuel production for all transport processes at a stroke (provided
   that diesel fuel production for transport is a background process).  

 * Fragment Traversal

   The most complex portion of fragment computation is fragment traversal.
   In this process, the activity levels for all nodes in a fragment are
   determined with respect to a unit activity level of the fragment's root
   node.  Computing these activity levels requires traversing each edge of
   the fragment in sequence and storing a cumulative product, which
   corresponds to the activity level of the current node.  Once the
   activity level of a node is known, that node can be "resolved" to a
   particular inventory model, which is used to compute LCIA scores for
   that node.  

   The results of traversal will in general be different for every
   scenario.  Traversal results can vary based on some parameter types but
   not others.  In LCA computation terms, fragment traversal depends on
   parameters that modify the A matrix, but not parameters that modify the
   B or E matrices.  Under the ParamType enumeration, these parameters
   include Dependency, Distribution, Conservation, and [some] FlowProperty
   types (ParamTypeIDs 1, 2, 3, 4).  The results of fragment traversal are
   cached in [NodeCache.NodeWeight].

   Composition, dissipation, and emission param types (ParamTypeIDs 5, 6,
   7, 8, 9) affect only the B matrix, and LCIA factor params (ParamTypeID
   10) affect only the E matrix.

   Internally to a fragment, traversal returns an array of FragmentNodeIDs
   and corresponding activity levels (where the activity level of the root
   node is always 1).  Externally to a fragment, traversal returns a vector
   of FragmentNodeIDs corresponding to fragment inputs and outputs, and
   their quantities with respect to a unit activity level of the root
   node. 

 * Nodes and Dependency Resolution

   The 'NodeType' property of a node determines how node activity levels
   are resolved to LCIA scores.  A node in a fragment can have four
   different types, with a distinction of a special subtype for the
   "Background" type.

   1. Process - This indicates that the node is modeled as an ILCD unit
      process stored in the database.  Computation of impacts simply
      requires LCIA computation for the process, and weighting by the
      activity level.  This is the recursive "base case".

   2. Fragment - This indicates that the node is modeled as a sub-fragment.
      In this case, the algorithm must recurse into the sub-fragment to
      determine and add up the impacts of that fragment's nodes.

   3. InputOutput - This indicates that the node represents the consumption
      of an external input or the generation of an external output.  This
      resolution does not generate any impacts from the perspective of the
      fragment; however, if the fragment is itself a sub-fragment of
      another "parent" fragment, then the inputs and outputs may be
      followed through the parent fragment after recursion completes.

   4. Background - This indicates that the node is modeled by a background
      process.  Background processes are common to all nodes and fragments
      and can themselves resolve to either processes or subfragments.
      However: a fragment used to resolve a background flow may not itself
      depend on any other background processes.  (in the future,
      co-dependence of background processes could be handled with a matrix
      inversion step, a la traditional LCA).

   5. If a background dependency cannot be resolved, it is treated as a 
      Cutoff, which becomes basically equivalent to an InputOutput- having
      no impacts. 

 * Fragment LCIA Computation

   Each node score can be computed with respect to a given scenario, based
   on node type resolution as described above.  After fragment traversal is
   complete, these node scores can be paired with node weights and summed
   to determine the fragment score.  Easy as pie.

   Obviously it is a little bit more complicated.  For one, there is an
   extension to the ILCD model to represent dissipation of flow
   constituents by a process (e.g. heavy metals in combustion fuels).
   There are three tables involved in this computation:

 * Dissipation of Flow Constituents
   
   This is an extension of the ILCD process type to include environmental
   dissipation of flow constituents.  A ProcessDissipation record
   modifies an existing emission to be determined from a FlowFlowProperty
   record rather than the originating ProcessFlow record.

   In order for dissipation to be computed, a process must be associated
   with a CompositionModel (table ProcessComposition).  Entries in
   CompositionData join FlowProperties to a particular FlowID (must be
   intermediate, must be massive, must be an input to the linked process).
   The FlowProperties are joined to Flows (must be elementary, must be
   outputs from the linked process), and the emission factors for those
   flows are calculated as the product of 
   	 CompositionData.Value * FlowPropertyEmission.Scale * ProcessDissipation.EmissionFactor 
   with EmissionFactor (and possibly in the future, CompositionData.Value)
   subject to parameterization.

   This value can then be merged with the original ProcessFlow list for the
   current process, with the emitted quantity used in place of pf.Result
   whenever it is non-null.

   ProcessDissipation records can override existing ProcessFlow emissions;
   they can't generate new emissions.  Emission factors can be modified on
   a process-specific basis (type 6 params- will affect all instances of
   the process) or a node-specific basis (type 7 params- will only affect
   the designated nodes). (note: type 7 and 9 params not implemented).

 * Fragment Sensitivity Computation

   Sensitivity measures how much the LCIA score changes with respect to a
   changing parameter.  Sensitivity is computed using another fragment
   traversal algorithm that accepts a ParamID as an argument.  As with LCIA
   score computation, the sensitivity of a fragment is equal to the
   weighted sum of the sensitivity of each node in the fragment, and so
   requires recursion into sub-fragments.  

   There are two types of parameters: those that affect traversal
   (i.e. the node cache), and those that affect LCIA computation (i.e. the
   score cache).  The sensitivity to a parameter holds one constant and
   varies the other.  

   For traversal params, i.e. dependency params, the tree must be traversed
   recursively only until a parameter instance is found-- parameterization
   of cascading dependency relationships is not supported.

   For impact params, recursive traversal is only necessary to identify
   affected nodes- which could almost as easily be done using a join to
   FragmentFlow.  The problem is fragments- anytime a node in a fragment is
   adjusted, all the instances of that fragment must also be adjusted- and
   all instances of any containing fragments- so it just becomes another
   recursive traversal from the other direction.

   Best to stick with the straight recursion.

   Under the current plan, the user will specify which parameters for which
   he/she wishes to know the sensitivity.  Then upon each fragment view,
   the sensitivity will be computed on the fly for each parameter and for
   each LCIA method, requiring a combinatorial number of traversals and
   recursions.  Because the model is not very complex, it is not
   anticipated to take longer than a fraction of a second to perform these
   computations, so they will be done on the fly.  However, it may be
   necessary to pre-compute and cache these sensitivity values, if
   computation is too sluggish or if the user requests a large number of
   sensitivity parameters.

 * All other components of interaction with the model will be handled from
   the front-end.  No other back-end computations are currently foreseen.
