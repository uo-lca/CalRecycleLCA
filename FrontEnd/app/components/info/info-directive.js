The network can be broken down into 'fragments' that each describe different parts of the model, such as used oil collection or improper disposal.  Each fragment looks like a tree and can be visualized as a flow diagram.  Fragments can be nested inside other fragments, in which case they are called 'sub-fragments.'",

Some processes also have environmental emissions, such as cobalt released into fresh water or carbon dioxide released to air.  These emissions, also called 'elementary flows,' are the source of all environmental impacts.",

Environmental impacts are estimated using life cycle impact assessment methods, or LCIA methods.  The LCIA methods implemented by this tool are shown in a table at the bottom of this page.",
