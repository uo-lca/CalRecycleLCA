Front-End Visualization
=======================

Interactive web application implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


Visualization is implemented with the help of D3.js and uses SVG. This necessitates running in a "modern" browser (see [Can I use SVG](http://caniuse.com/svg)). 

### LciaComputation


User selects LCIA Method, Impact Category and Process from drop down selection lists. LCIA computation is performed and the total impact score is displayed. A stacked bar chart displays the asscociated elementary flows, where the size of each flow represents it's positive contribution to the total score.

### How to Deploy

Copy Visualization folder to a web server folder.
